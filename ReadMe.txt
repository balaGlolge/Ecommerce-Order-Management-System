Project Use Case
Use Case: E-commerce Order Management System (OMS)

In this project, we built an E-commerce Order Management System where users can place orders for products, track their status, and receive notifications.
It will integrate various technologies and features such as:

Microservices Architecture: We will have multiple services like User Service, Order Service, Product Service, and Payment Service.

Message Queues for Asynchronous Communication:

Use Kafka for order status updates and notifications.
Use RabbitMQ for real-time, synchronous communication between services.
Spring Boot: Each service will be built using Spring Boot.

Spring Security and OAuth: Implement authentication for users and secure communication between services using OAuth2.

Hibernate (JPA): Use Hibernate for database interaction.

Jenkins for CI/CD: Jenkins will be used for automating the build, testing, and deployment process.

JUnit and Mockito: Unit and integration testing for all services.

Cloud Deployment (AWS):

Deploy services on AWS EC2.
